y-axis
theta revolution around y-axis [= azimuth phi]
r distance from the axis [ = axial distance rho]
S = shape of generating curve
W = whorl expansion rate
D = position of the generating curve in relation to the axis
T = rates of whorl translation

B = (0,0)

r_theta = r_0 * W^(theta/(2*pi))

if T=0, y_theta = y_0 * W^(theta/(2*pi))

in helicoid forms: y_theta = y_0 * W^(theta/(2*pi)) + r_c*T*(W^(theta/(2*pi))-1)

T = dy/dr
r_c = r-value of the center of the initial generating curve


cylindrical to cartesian:

x = rho * cos phi
y = rho * sin phi
z = z



S = f/b from 0.1 to 10
W from 1 to 1e6 by x10
T from 0 to 4 by 0.5
D from 0 to 1 by 0.1
